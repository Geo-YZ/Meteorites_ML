# Predicting Differentiated Achondrite Parent Bodies Through Machine Learning: Insights from Major Element

## Abstract
In this study, we examined the performance of machine learning algorithms using bulk rock major element compositions to classify the origins of achondrites derived from the Moon, Mars, and asteroid 4 Vesta.
This study presents a new, automated method in identifying the parent body of achondrites through bulk rock major element data. To facilitate the broader use by meteorite collectors, cosmochemistry community and enthusiasts, a web interface has been developed to quickly apply this technique: https://geo-cosmo-chemistry.shinyapps.io/meteorites_classification/.
